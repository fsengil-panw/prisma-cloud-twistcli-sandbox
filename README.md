# prisma-cloud-twistcli-sandbox
The workflow to use Prisma Cloud's twistcli sandbox and AWS EC2 Spot Instances represents a modern, cloud-native approach to automated malware analysis. This method is not only highly scalable but also extremely cost-effective.

Here is the updated, step-by-step guide to creating this advanced Jenkins pipeline.

Core Concepts and New Workflow
The fundamental principle of isolating and destroying the analysis environment remains, but the tools change significantly:

Analysis Engine: We will replace the external WildFire API with Prisma Cloud's twistcli, a powerful command-line tool that can directly analyze files in a sandbox environment provided by the Prisma Cloud platform.

Compute Environment: Instead of a local Vagrant VM, we will use AWS EC2 Spot Instances. These are spare EC2 capacity offered at a significant discount, perfect for our short-lived, fault-tolerant analysis tasks. Jenkins will automatically provision and terminate these instances for us.

The new workflow looks like this:

Secure Credential Storage: Store AWS and Prisma Cloud credentials in the Jenkins Credential Manager.

Dynamic Agent Provisioning: The Jenkins pipeline requests a build agent. The Jenkins EC2 plugin intercepts this request and provisions a new EC2 Spot Instance based on a pre-defined template.

Analysis Execution: Once the Spot Instance is online and connected as a Jenkins agent, the pipeline:
a. Checks out the repository containing the malware sample.
b. Downloads the twistcli binary from your Prisma Cloud Console.
c. Executes the twistcli sandbox command, passing the malware sample to it. The tool securely uploads the file to the Prisma Cloud backend for sandboxed detonation and analysis.

Process Results: twistcli outputs a detailed JSON report. The pipeline parses this report to determine the verdict (e.g., malware, suspicious, benign) and takes action, such as failing the build if malware is detected.

Automatic Teardown: Once the pipeline job is complete, the Jenkins EC2 plugin automatically terminates the Spot Instance. This ensures you only pay for the exact time used and that the contaminated environment is destroyed.

Prerequisites
Prisma Cloud Compute Edition: You need an active subscription and credentials (Access Key, Secret Key, and Console URL).

AWS Account: With an IAM user or role that has permissions to manage EC2 instances.

Jenkins Server: With the EC2 Plugin installed.

Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Configure the Jenkins EC2 Plugin
This is the most critical setup step and is done in the Jenkins UI, not the Jenkinsfile.

Add AWS Credentials:

Go to Manage Jenkins > Credentials.

Add a new AWS Credentials type.

Provide the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key of your IAM user.

Give it a descriptive ID like aws-ec2-credentials.

Configure the EC2 Cloud:

Go to Manage Jenkins > Clouds.

Click Add a new cloud and select Amazon EC2.

In the cloud configuration:

AWS Credentials: Select the aws-ec2-credentials you just created.

AWS Region: Choose the region where you want to launch the instances (e.g., us-east-1).

Click Add AMI. This defines the template for your analysis agents.

AMI ID: Use a recent Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu AMI ID (e.g., ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0).

Instance Type: Choose a suitable type, like t3.medium.

Security group(s): Use a security group that allows inbound SSH (TCP/22) from your Jenkins controller's IP address and blocks all other inbound traffic. Outbound traffic to the internet (for downloading twistcli and connecting to Prisma Cloud) should be allowed.

Labels: Assign a unique label, like ec2-spot-sandbox. The Jenkinsfile will use this label to request an agent from this template.

Advanced Settings: This is where you enable Spot Instances.

Check the Use Spot instance box.

Set a Spot max bid price. You can leave this blank to bid the On-Demand price, which is generally recommended.

Save the configuration.

Step 2: Store Prisma Cloud Credentials in Jenkins
Go to Manage Jenkins > Credentials.

Add new credentials with the Username with password kind.

Username: Enter your Prisma Cloud Access Key.

Password: Enter your Prisma Cloud Secret Key.

ID: Give it a descriptive ID, like prisma-cloud-credentials.

Add another credential of kind String.

Secret: Enter the full URL to your Prisma Cloud Console (e.g., https://us-east1.cloud.twistlock.com/my-company).

ID: Give it an ID like prisma-console-url.

Step 3: Create the Jenkinsfile
This declarative pipeline script automates the analysis on the dynamically provisioned Spot Instance.

Security & Cost-Efficiency Summary
Cost: By using EC2 Spot Instances, you are running your analysis on compute capacity that can be up to 90% cheaper than On-Demand rates. Since the task is short-lived, the risk of a Spot interruption is minimal and acceptable.

Security: The environment is maximally isolated. Each analysis runs on a brand new, clean OS. After the job, the instance is terminated, completely destroying any trace of the malware sample or its execution. IAM roles and security groups provide further layers of protection at the AWS level.

Scalability: The Jenkins EC2 plugin can be configured to spin up multiple agents in parallel, allowing you to run hundreds of analyses simultaneously without managing any fixed infrastructure.
